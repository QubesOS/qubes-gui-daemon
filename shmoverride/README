	The shmoverride.so library is supposed to be loaded by Xorg server
(via LD_PRELOAD). It intercepts the shmat, shmdt and shmctl glibc calls, so
that when XShmAttach is called (by qubes_guid) with a "magic" argument, then 
instead of attaching regular shared memory, memory from a foreign domain is
attached via xc_map_foreign_pages. This mechanism is used to map composition
buffers from a foreign domain into Xorg server.
	During its init, shmoverride.so creates a shared memory segment
(cmd_pages) and writes its shmid to /var/run/qubes/shm.id. All instances of
qubes_guid map this segment and communicate with shmoverride.so code by
setting its fields. When qubes_guid wants its
XShmAttach(...synth_shmid...) call to be handled by shmoverride.so, it sets the 
"shmid" field in the cmd_pages shared memory segment to synth_shmid just
before calling XShmAttach. Function shmat (implemented in shmoverride.so)
checks whether first argument of shmat is equal to cmd_pages->shmid, and if
so, calls xc_map_foreign_pages properly (if not, just calls real shmat).
Other fields in cmd_pages describe which frames are supposed to be mapped 
and from which domain.
	Somewhat unfortunately, the Xorg server tracks the already attached shmids.
Therefore, it is not possible to pass the same "magic" value of synth_shmid
to XShmAttach(...synth_shmid...). Before each XShmAttach, qubes_guid creates
a temporary ("real") shared memory segment, sets cmd_pages->shmid to it, and
then executes XShmAttach. This temporary segment is destroyed after
XShmAttach completes.
