  # You might disable this for of a VM that may create very large windows that
  # have the override_redirect flag set. This flag allows a window to
  # unconditionally cover all other windows and causes the window manager to
  # make it impossible to minimize or hide the window in question.
  #
  # Qubes OS will prevent a window having the override_redirect flag set from
  # covering more than 90% of the screen as a protection measure. The
  # protection measure unsets this flag and lets the window manager (and hence
  # the user) control the window.
  #
  # If this causes issues with a VM's or an application's usage, you can
  # disable this protection for a specific VM.

  # "disabled" to ignore this flag and render as if the flag were not set.

  # Qubes OS already provides protection against serious abuse of
  # override_redirect windows.

  # Forbid or allow X11 subwindows (windows with a parent other than the root
  # window).  None of the GUI agents included with Qubes OS create such
  # windows, and future versions of the GUI agent also will not create them.
  # Furthermore, subwindows were involved in one of the exploits for QSB#072.
  # Therefore, the default is to disable subwindows.  Applications that *use*
  # subwindows are not affected and will still work.
